                The above teachers served as role models and motivators in the quarter, through them many people had the advantage of early education, they also encouraged their relations to send their children to school. The quest for Western education for children became a competition in the quarter and parents were ready to borrow and obtain loans to pay the school fees of their children. The citing of Salvation army Church and primary school in the quarter became a added advantage, parents could send their children to school with minimal efforts.
